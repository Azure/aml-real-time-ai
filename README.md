# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models Powered by Project Brainwave

Easily create and train a model using various deep neural networks (DNNs) as a featurizer for deployment on Azure for ultra-low latency inferencing.  These models are currently available:

* ResNet 50
* ResNet 152
* DenseNet-121
* VGG-16

## How to get access

Azure ML Hardware Accelerated Models is currently in preview.

### Step 1: Create an Azure ML workspace

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python) to install the Azure ML SDK on your local machine, create an Azure ML workspace, and set up your notebook environment, which is required for the next step.

**Note:** Only workspaces in the **East US 2** region are currently supported.

Once you have set up your environment, install the contrib extras:

```sh
pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk[contrib]
```

Currently only tensorflow version<=1.10 is supported, so install it at the end:

```sh
pip install "tensorflow==1.10"
```

Go to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service) page for any questions.

### Step 2: Deploy your service

Check out the sample notebooks [here](https://aka.ms/aml-notebook-proj-brainwave).

**Note:** You can deploy one FPGA service.  If you want to deploy more than one service, you must [request quota](https://aka.ms/aml-real-time-ai-request) by submitting the form.  You will need information from your workspace created in Step 1 ([learn how to get workspace information](docs/README.md)).  You will receive an email if your quota request has been successful.
