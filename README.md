# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models Powered by Project Brainwave

Easily create and train a model using ResNet 50 as a featurizer for deployment on Azure for ultra-low latency inferencing.

## How to get access

Azure ML Hardware Accelerated Models is currently in preview.

### Step 1: Create an Azure ML Model Management Account

Go to the [Azure Portal](https://aka.ms/aml-create-mma) and create an Azure ML Model Management Account (MMA).  [Learn how to create a MMA](docs/README.md#create-azure-ml-model-management-account).  If you already have an existing S1, S2, or S3 account in the East US 2 location, you may skip this step.  The DevTest tier is not supported.

**Note:** Only accounts in the **East US 2** region are currently supported.

### Step 2: Fill out the request form

[Request quota](https://aka.ms/aml-real-time-ai-request) by submitting the form.

You will need the name of your MMA from Step 1 ([learn how to get the MMA name](docs/README.md#get-mma-information)).

You will receive an email if your quota request has been successful.

### Step 3: Set up environment

Follow [these instructions](docs/README.md#set-up-environment) to set up your environment.

### Step 4: Deploy your service

Check out the sample notebooks [here](notebooks/resnet50).  You can easily deploy a ResNet 50 classifier by running the [Quickstart notebook](notebooks/resnet50/00_QuickStart.ipynb).
